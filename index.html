		<h3>Do you ever look at <a href="http://firstlook.org/theintercept/documents/">this page</a> and feel really annoyed?</h3>
    <p>No? No that was just me? Well, OK.</p><p>
    So. This really annoys <em>me</em> because it's not really helpful to a researcher or someone who wants to maybe sift through the documents and get a bigger grasp of what's been learned from them. There's no search, no filters, no path back to the original article citing this document. How does anyone figure out what a document actually <em>proves</em>?</p>
		<p>I scraped a bunch of articles on The Intercept for links to documents hosted on their Documents page. Then I scraped some of the meta tags on those stories to get brief descriptions about them. It isn't every single document because I didn't use a complete list of every Intercept article ever. This is a thing to work on, I know. Please help if you want to help!</p>
		<p>Other news websites that have published Snowden documents have done a somewhat better job contextualizing their releases&mdash;like look how <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/jan/16/nsa-dishfire-text-messages-documents">The Guardian</a> does it! And look at the work the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/nsa-documents-search">ACLU</a> is doing making Snowden documents searchable! This is not impossible, and I think it's something The Intercept cares about doing at some point. I mean, this is a thing I probably wouldn't have even made if <a href="http://github.com/joshbegley/NSA-Stories">Josh Begley</a> and Margot Williams over at The Intercept hadn't started compiling an index of released documents which gave me a csv of articles to use as a starting point. (Thanks Josh and Margot you are really cool.)</p>
    <p>This project was partly to solve a problem for me and partly so I could learn some things. I totally did! More on how I actually made this in <a href="http://github.com/lifewinning/NSA-Stories">the repo</a>.</p>
